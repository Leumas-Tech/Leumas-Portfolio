1.  **Admin Portal:** Create a simple, password-protected admin portal that allows the owner to upload and edit the JSON data files without having to touch the code.
2.  **Click Tracking:** Integrate a simple analytics system to track clicks on the portfolio items and other links. This could be a simple server-side solution that logs clicks to a file or a database.
3.  **Microservice:** Explore the possibility of publishing the project as a microservice that users can easily deploy and configure for their own use. This would involve creating a more robust and configurable system that can be easily deployed to a cloud provider.
